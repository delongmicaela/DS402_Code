# DS402_Final Project
--------------------------

Inside this github repository I have the READme, the code provided into the zip file again and a short pdf of what the code should look like after it runs.


The code is in the main branch when you go into the Code tab on the right hand side, clicking on the redisgned space telegram.
The run time for the code did take a while.
